DESCRIPTION

Viridian is an ergonomic "chalkboard" green background colorscheme for text
editors and terminals.  It aims to reduce eyestrain while maintaining high
readability. It is the evolution and extension of the Vim color scheme
tabula.vim, which itself is based on an earlier scheme called marklar.vim.
